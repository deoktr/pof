# TODO
# - do it without using PIL !
# - spread the message in the image, and encode the "separation" between each
#   bits at the beginning
# - encode a single bit within 2 bits of the image, instead of just using a
#   single LSB (Least Significant Bit) use the last 2 bits and pass it through a
#   modulus 2 to get a single bit:
#
#       >>> 0b00 % 2
#       0
#       >>> 0b10 % 2
#       0
#       >>> 0b01 % 2
#       1
#       >>> 0b11 % 2
#       1
#
#   This method will ensure that we only need to change at most 1 bit and this
#   bit can either be the last or the second last bit.
# - even better set the last 2 bits for every colors and pass do a modulus on
#   it, so we encode a single bit on 6 bits, and will only need to change a
#   single one bit a time from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 if and only if the result of the
#   modulus doesn't already encode what we want, example:
#
#       >>> 0b000100 % 2
#       0
#       >>> 0b000101 % 2
#       1
#       >>> 0b000110 % 2
#       0
#       >>> 0b000111 % 2
#       1
