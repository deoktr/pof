"""Shannon entropy.

Calculate the Shannon entropy of a file.

- https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/file-entropy/
- https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.entropy.html

from tests:
a basic entropy of a Python source code is around 4.3
when compressing the entropy is between 4.25 and 4.4
when using unicode variables the entropy is around 6.2
